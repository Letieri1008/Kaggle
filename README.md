Heart Disease Cleveland UCI
Resolution: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci

he data is already presented in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci but there are some descriptions and values that are wrong as discussed in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877. So, here is re-processed dataset that was cross-checked with the original data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease.
Content

- Neste repositório iremos demonstrar gráficos e estatísticas utilizando python pelo Jupyter lab
- Futuramente, iremos realizar um modelo de Maching Learning para calcular de forma automática o número de falsos positivos, e verificar qual modelo representa mais efetividade.

There are 13 attributes

    age: age in years
    
    sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
    
    cp: chest pain type

    trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
    chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
    fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
    
    restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    
    - Value 0: normal
    - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
    
    thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
    exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
