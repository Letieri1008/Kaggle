he data is already presented in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci but there are some descriptions and values that are wrong as discussed in https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877. So, here is re-processed dataset that was cross-checked with the original data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease.
